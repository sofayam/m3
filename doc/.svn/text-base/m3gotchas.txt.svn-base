Top X Favorite M3 Syntax errors

1) = instead of := (also in method assignment)
2) end tag for procedure forgotten
3) lower case keyword (e.g. 'of' instead of 'OF') - use emacs fontlock mode and M-u
4) missing semicolon (DOH!)
5) missing (usually closing) brackets
6) missing BEGIN before END of module 
7) ELSIF also needs THEN (sigh)
8) type mismatch : trust the compiler and look at the left and right hand sides really hard
9) missing VAR, TYPE, CONST
