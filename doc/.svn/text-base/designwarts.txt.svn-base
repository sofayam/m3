Design warts or YAGNIs which I actually should have implemented
----------------------------------------------------------------

path handling (should I just honestly kill this and say - "all user code in one directory" ?)

access to child capsule node

lexing : move to Context sensitive to avoid 100 Named groups limitation (else you need a patched python) 
         Update 5.01.2004: latest version of TPG can deal with more than 100 but its slower
